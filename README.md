# My first FreeCodeCamp challenge

As a Pythonista I decided to _upgrade_ my skills and learn HTML, CSS, JS...
It will make easier to make more interesting web apps (based on Flask).

The code is also available on [_CodePen_](https://codepen.io/tmpbit/pen/aWWeEz).

If you have any suggestions please let me know [here](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/my-tribute-page-is-awaiting-comments-thanks/112874). Thanks
